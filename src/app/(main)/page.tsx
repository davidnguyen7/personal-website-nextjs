          I am a software engineer who&apos;s always eager to learn & program,
          fortunate enough to have been introduced at a young age.

          I&apos;ve been currently obsessed with web development - with its
          potential to make awesome cross-platform experiences that are easily
          sharable & accessible to others.

          Wanting to deepen my knowledge of mobile web development, I&apos;ve
          recently been getting my feet wet within the native mobile space with
          React Native to help me gain a deeper understanding and appreciation
          of mobile UI, UX & performance considerations.
