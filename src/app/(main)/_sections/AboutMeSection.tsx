          As a Sydney-based software developer passionate about web development,
          I work on creating accessible, cross-platform (and awesome!)
          experiences that are both incredibly fast and fun to use.

        <p>
          I strongly believe that all software should be created with love, care
          and attention built-in; that it shouldn&apos;t be made to
          <i> &ldquo;just work&rdquo;</i>, but made to blow people away. It is
          that philosophy that I strive to follow in all the work that I do.
        </p>

          When not deep within my usual webdev work, I enjoy spending my time
          messing around with my Debian server, experimenting with shaders &
          game dev and reading up on fascinating stories & anecdotes from all
          walks of programming, familiar and unfamiliar.
